## ðŸ“‰ The Problem

Most SMBs track assets in spreadsheets, QuickBooks, or Xero.  
These systems werenâ€™t built for proof or portability.

â€¢ No portable proof across platforms

**Asset Passports** on-chain.  
Issue a tamper-proof record for each asset with just a few clicks.

â€¢ Works with your existing system  
â€¢ No crypto knowledge needed  
â€¢ Portable, verifiable, and queryable
